## 🎯 Best Practices for Large Inventory

### 1. **Use Category-Based Numbering**
Group similar products together:
- Pens: 1-20
- Pencils: 21-40
- Notebooks: 101-150
- Art supplies: 201-250

### 2. **Leave Gaps for Future Products**
Don't use consecutive numbers:
- ✅ Good: 1, 5, 10, 15, 20
- ❌ Avoid: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

This lets you add new products in the same category later!

### 3. **Use Search for Quick Access**
With 200+ products, searching is faster:
- Type product name in search box
- Click from results
- Added to bill instantly!

### 4. **Memorize Common Product Numbers**
Keep a printed list of your top 20-30 products:
- Faster keyboard entry
- No need to scroll
- Quick billing

System waits 0.5 seconds for multi-digit numbers.
